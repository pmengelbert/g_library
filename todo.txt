Hi Peter,

Thank you for completing this project. We appreciate the time you put into your work!

I reviewed your Technical Assessment, and have the following feedback to share with you:

Code:
-----

-> If you take a sweep of other classes, you will find similar responsibilities that you
can group into their own modules! For example, the printing logic inside of the
user_library class.

General Question:
-----------------

-> Now that you've written a console application, think about how your application would
need to change if you wanted it to be served as a mobile app, or a web app. How
difficult would it be to repurpose your current implementation to satisfy a different
one?

-> Please consider my notes and take the opportunity to refactor your code to complete
this step in your interview process. This second and final submission is due in 4 business
days. 

-> Please let me know if you have any questions and when you're done refactoring. 

Thanks,
Sylwia
